*Fill in the blanks in each of the following statements:*

**a)** A method is invoked with a ***method call***.

**b)** A variable known only within the method in which it’s declared is called a ***local variable***.

**c)** The ***return*** statement in a called method can be used to pass the value of an expression back to the calling method.

**d)** The keyword ***void*** indicates that a method does not return a value.

**e)** Data can be added to or removed from only the ***top*** of a stack.

**f)** Stacks are known as **LIFO** data structures—the last item pushed (inserted) on the stack is the first item popped off (removed from) the stack.

**g)** The three ways to return control from a called method to a caller are ***return;***, ***return expression;*** and ***closing right brace***.

**h)** An object class ***Random*** produces pseudorandom numbers.

**i)** The program-execution stack contains the memory for local variables on each invocation of a method during an app’s execution. This data, stored as a portion of the program-execution stack, is known as the ***?*** or ***?***  of the method call.

**j)** If there are more method calls than can be stored on the program-execution stack, an error known as a ***stack overflow*** occurs.

**k)** The ***scope*** of a declaration is the portion of an app that can refer to the entity in the declaration by its unqualified name. 

**l)** It’s possible to have several methods with the same name that each operate on different types or numbers of arguments. This feature is called method ***overload***.

**m)** The program-execution stack is also referred to as the ***?*** stack

**n)** A method that calls itself either directly or indirectly is a ***recursive*** method.

**o)** A recursive method typically has two components: one that provides a means for the recursion to terminate by testing for a ***base*** case and one that express the problem as a recursive call for a slightly simpler problem than does the original call.

**p)** In an expression-bodied method or read-only property, the symbol ***=>*** the method’s or read-only-property get accessor’s body.

**q)** Types are either ***value*** or ***reference*** types.
