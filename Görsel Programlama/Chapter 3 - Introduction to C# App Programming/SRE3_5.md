# **Write declarations, statements or comments that accomplish each of the following tasks.**

**a)** State that an app will calculate the product of three integers.

```
// Three Integer Product Calculation
```

**b)** Declare the variables x, y, z and result to be of type int.

```
int x, y, z, result;
```

**c)** Prompt the user to enter the first integer.

```
Console.Write("First Integer : ");
```

**d)** Read the first integer from the user and store it in the variable x.

```
x = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
```

**e)** Prompt the user to enter the Second integer.

```
Console.Write("Second Integer : ");
```

**f)** Read the first integer from the user and store it in the variable y.

```
y = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
```

**g)** Prompt the user to enter the Third integer.

```
Console.Write("Third Integer : ");
```

**h)** Read the first integer from the user and store it in the variable z.

```
z = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
```

**i)** Compute the product of the three integers contained in variables x, y and z, and assign the result to the variable result.

```
result = x * y * z;
```

**j)** Display the message "Product is", followed by the value of the variable resultâ€”use string interpolation.

```
Console.WriteLine(Result : {result});
```
