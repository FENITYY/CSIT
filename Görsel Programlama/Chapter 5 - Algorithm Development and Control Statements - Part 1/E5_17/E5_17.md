***Interest on Term Deposit***

// Algorithm

```
1. Start
2. Create a variable that contains total combined interests.
3. Prompt to user enter the amount interested and inform the user about entering negative amount cause exit of the program.
4. Take a value from user.
5. Check if its integer or not. if integer, continue program; else, prompt user to enter a valid integer.
6. If user enters an negative value, exit the loop.
7. Prompt user to enter the interest earned.
8. Take a value from user and use it as a string.
9. If user entered an invalid value, ask user again to enter a valid value.
10. combinedInterest = amount * interest / 100.0;
11. totalInterests += (int)Math.Round(combinedInterest, 2);
12. Output : combinedInterests
13. Output : totalInterests
14. Stop
```

// Pseudo Code

```
totalInterests = 0

Print "Enter investment details. Enter a negative amount to exit."

while true:
    Print "Enter the amount invested (negative to exit): "
    amountInput = ReadLine()

    if not IsInteger(amountInput):
        Print "Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer."
        Continue to the next iteration of the loop

    amount = ParseInteger(amountInput)

    if amount < 0:
        Break out of the loop

    Print "Enter the interest earned: "
    interestInput = ReadLine()

    if not IsInteger(interestInput):
        Print "Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer."
        Continue to the next iteration of the loop

    interest = ParseInteger(interestInput)

    combinedInterest = amount * interest / 100.0
    totalInterests += Round(combinedInterest, 2)
    
    Print "Combined interest for this investment: ", FormatCurrency(combinedInterest)

Print "Total combined interests for all investments: ", FormatCurrency(totalInterests)
