*What type of iteration would be appropriate for calculating the sum of the first 100 positive integers? What type of iteration would be appropriate for calculating the sum of an arbitrary number of positive integers? Briefly describe how each of these tasks could be performed.*

We use while iteration loops for calculationg the sum of first 100 positive integers. It can bu used for calculation the sum of an arbitary number of positive integers.

When we use while, we need a condition that states when will loop ends, sometimes this could be a counter.

```
while (x < 10) {
    // This commands will run until condition is set.
}
```

For the sum of the first 100 positive integers:

```
using System;

class Calculation{
    static void Main(){
        // Variables defined
        int x = 1;
        int sum = 0;

        // Loop that adds x to sum until x is greater than 100.
        while (x <= 100){
            sum += x;
            ++x;
        }
    }
}
```

For the sum of an arbitary number of posotove integers:

```
using System;

class Calculation
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int sum = 0;
        int userInput;
        string input;

        Console.WriteLine("Enter positive integers to calculate their sum. Enter a non-positive integer to finish.");

        while (true)
        {
            Console.Write("Enter an integer: ");
            input = Console.ReadLine();

            // Try parsing the input, break the loop if it's not a valid integer
            if (!int.TryParse(input, out userInput) || userInput <= 0)
            {
                break;
            }

            sum += userInput;
        }

        Console.WriteLine($"The sum of the entered positive integers is: {sum}");
    }
}
```
