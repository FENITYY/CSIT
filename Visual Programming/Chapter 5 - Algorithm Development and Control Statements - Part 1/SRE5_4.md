*Write C# statements to accomplish each of the following tasks:*

**a)** Assign the sum of x and y to z, and increment x by 1 with ++. Use only one statement and ensure that the original value of x is used in the statement.

```
z += x + y
x++;
```

**b)** Test whether variable count is greater than 10. If it is, display "Count is greater than 10".

```
if (test > 10){
    Console.WriteLine("Count is greater than 10.");
}
```

**c)** Decrement the variable x by 1, then subtract it from the variable total. Use only one statement.

```
total -= --x;
```

**d)** Calculate the remainder after q is divided by divisor, and assign the result to q. Write this statement in two different ways

```
q = q % divisor;
g %= divisor;
```
